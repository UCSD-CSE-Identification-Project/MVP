addZero: takes in a string that is the name of the image and add a zero to the start of the number portion of the image -- doing so would allow us to sort numbers in ascending order ( without this method the sort method would sort in the order 1,10,11,2â€¦)

makeSingleRequest: this method issues a post request to the google cloud function ( that cloud function will eventually call the image matching alg); the parameters of the post request are the previous and current term id values

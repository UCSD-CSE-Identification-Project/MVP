    <p>Select the question type for each clicker question: individual, group or ignore.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Individual</strong>:  when students are expected to answer on their own <br />
        <strong>Group</strong>: when students are allowed to discuss their answers with each other <br />
        <strong>Ignore</strong>: when question is not directly related to class content.<br />
        <br />
        An individual question is usually followed by an identical group question, but if it is not identical, select the checkbox that says “This is a Group vote question unrelated to previous questions”
